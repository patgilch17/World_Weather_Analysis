## Purpose
This week we were tasked with accessing a number of API's in order to create some hypothetical travel plans.  We used the OpenWeatherMap API to determine current weather for a large number of randomly generated cities.  Then based off an input of temperature range determined which cities were acceptable.  Next we called upon the GeoAPIfy in order to determine a potential hotel at each of these cities.  Finally, as an example we pre-selected 4 cities within the same country, I used Brazil, and created potential route between those cities, once again using the GeoAPIfy.  I decided to create this route using the setting Mountain Bike as the mode of transportation... So get ready to ride!
